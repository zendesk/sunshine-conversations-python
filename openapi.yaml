    # Introduction


    <aside class="notice">As a stepping stone to new and greater things, we’ve
    updated Sunshine Conversations API to v2. For users wanting to access v1,
    please proceed <a href="https://docs.smooch.io/rest/v1">here</a>. 

    </aside>


    Welcome to the Sunshine Conversations API. The API allows you to craft
    entirely unique messaging experiences for your app and website as well as
    talk to any backend or external service.


    The Sunshine Conversations API is designed according to REST principles. The
    API accepts JSON in request bodies and requires that the content-type:
    application/json header be specified for

    all such requests. The API will always respond with an object. Depending on
    context, resources may be returned as single objects or as arrays of
    objects, nested within the response object.


    In some cases, the API will also facilitate cross-origin resource sharing so
    that it can be called from a web application.


    <aside class="notice">Note that for authenticated requests, cross-origin
    resource sharing is only available to appUser scoped credentials. Attempting
    to call the API from the browser using 

    app or account scoped credentials will result in a <a
    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin
    policy</a> browser error. For more information, refer 

    to the <a
    href="http://docs.smooch.io/guide/authorization/#handle-credentials-with-caution">Authorization
    guide</a>.</aside>


    ## Regions


    Sunshine Conversations is available in the following regions. Each Sunshine
    Conversations region has its own API host.


    | Region         | Host                       |

    | -------------- | -------------------------- |

    | United States  | https://api.smooch.io      |

    | European Union | https://api.eu-1.smooch.io |


    For more information on regions, visit [the guide](/guide/regions/).


    <aside class="notice">When configuring an API host, make sure to always use
    `https`. Some API clients can have unexpected behaviour when following
    redirects from `http` to `https`.</aside>


    ## Errors


    Sunshine Conversations uses standard HTTP status codes to communicate
    errors. In general, a `2xx` status code indicates success while `4xx`
    indicates an error, in which case, the response body includes a JSON object
    which includes an array of errors, with a text `code` and `title` containing
    more details. Multiple errors can only be included in a `400 Bad Request`. A
    `5xx` status code indicates that something went wrong on our end.


    ```javascript

    {
       "errors":  [
        {
            "code": "unauthorized",
            "title": "Authorization is required"
        }
       ]
    }

    ```


    ## API Version


    The latest version of the API is v2. Version v1.1 is still supported and you
    can continue using it but we encourage you to upgrade to the latest version.
    To learn more about API versioning at Sunshine Conversations, including
    instructions on how to upgrade to the latest version, [visit our
    docs](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/versioning).


    ## API Pagination and Records Limits


    Some APIs can be paginated by providing the `offset` query string parameter.


    The `offset` is the number of initial records to skip before picking records
    to return (default 0).


    The `limit` query string can also be provided to change the number of
    records to return (maximum

    100, default 25).


    All paginated endpoints will eventually support cursor pagination and
    `offset` based pagination support will be dropped.


    ### Cursor Pagination


    Some APIs are paginated through cursor pagination. Rather than providing an
    `offset`, a `page[after]` or `page[before]` query string parameter may be
    provided. `page[after]` and `page[before]` are cursors pointing to a record
    id.


    The `page[after]` cursor indicates that only records **subsequent** to it
    should be returned.


    The `page[before]` cursor indicates that only records **preceding** it
    should be returned.


    **Only one** of `page[after]` or `page[before]` may be provided in a query,
    not both.


    In cursor pagination, the equivalent to the `limit` query string is the
    `page[size]` query string parameter.


    ## API Libraries


    Sunshine Conversations provides an official API library for
    [Java](https://github.com/zendesk/sunshine-conversations-java), with more
    languages to come. These helpful libraries wrap calls to the API and can
    make interfacing with Sunshine Conversations easier.


    ## Postman Collection


    <a
    style="display:inline-block;background:url(https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg);height:30px;width:
    123px;"
    href="https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/0c7cc8fc66039065d20f"></a>


    In addition to API libraries, Sunshine Conversations also has a Postman
    collection that can be used for development or testing purposes. See the
    [guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/postman-collection/) for information on
    how to install and use the collection in your Postman client.


    ## Rate Limits


    Sunshine Conversations APIs are subject to rate limiting. If the rate limit
    is exceeded Sunshine Conversations may return a `429 Too Many Requests` HTTP
    status code. We apply rate limits to prevent abuse, spam, denial-of-service
    attacks, and similar issues. Our goal is to keep the limits high enough so
    that any application using Sunshine Conversations as intended will not
    encounter them. However usage spikes do occur and encountering a rate limit
    may be unavoidable. In order to avoid production outages, when calling the
    Sunshine Conversations API you should implement `429` retry logic using
    exponential backoff and jitter.


    If your use case involves making API calls in bulk, please [contact
    us](https://smooch.io/contact).


    ## Request Size Limits


    The Sunshine Conversations API imposes the following size limits on HTTP
    requests:


    | Request Type | Limit |

    | ------------ | ----- |

    | JSON         | 100kb |

    | File upload  | 50mb  |


    ## Authorization


    This is an overview of how authorization works with the Sunshine
    Conversations API. Sunshine Conversations allows basic authentication or
    JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) as authentication methods for server-to-server calls.
    [See below](#authentication) for more details.

    There are two different authorization scopes available - app and account.


    | Scope   | Authorized Methods                       |

    | ------- | ---------------------------------------- |

    | app     | All methods besides Account Provisioning |

    | account | All methods                              |


    The app scope can be used to access any of the Sunshine Conversations APIs,
    besides account provisioning methods, on behalf of a single app, or any app
    user related to that app. The account scope can be used to access any of the
    Sunshine Conversations and Account Provisioning APIs on behalf of the
    account owner, any app belonging to the account, or any app user related to
    those apps.


    <aside class="notice">An additional scope of `appUser` can also be used to
    authenticate users when using one of the Sunshine Conversations native SDK
    integrations. For information on how and when to use this scope, see the
    guide for <a
    href="https://docs.smooch.io/guide/authenticating-users/">authenticating
    users.</a></aside>


    ## Authentication


    To authenticate requests to the API, you will need an API key, composed of a
    key id and a secret.

    For an overview of how authentication works in Sunshine Conversations and
    instructions on how to generate an API key, see the guide.

    API requests can be authenticated in two ways:


    - With Basic authentication you can make requests using an API key directly.

    - With JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) you sign tokens with an API key, which are
    then used to authenticate with the API. See [When to Use
    JWTs?](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/jwt/#when-to-use-jwts) to learn if JWTs
    are relevant for your usage.

    - Before using an API key in production, make sure to familiarize yourself
    with best practices on how to [securely handle
    credentials](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/authentication-secure-credential-handling/).


    ### Basic Authentication


    API requests can be authenticated with [basic
    authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)
    using an API key. The key id is used as the username and the secret as the
    password. The scope of access is determined by the owner of the API key. See
    the
    [guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/basic-authentication/#scope-of-access)
    for more details.


    ### JWTs


    JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are an industry standard authentication method. The
    full specification is described [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519),
    and a set of supported JWT libraries for a variety of languages and
    platforms can be found at http://jwt.io. To summarize, a JWT is composed of
    a header, a payload, and a signature. The payload contains information
    called claims which describe the subject to whom the token was issued.

    The JWT itself is transmitted via the HTTP `authorization` header. The token
    should be prefixed with “Bearer” followed by a space. For example: `Bearer
    your-jwt`.

    To generate a JWT, you need an API key, which is composed of a key ID and a
    secret. The key ID is included in a JWT’s header, as the `kid` property,
    while the secret is used to sign the JWT.

    For more in-depth coverage, see the
    [guide](https://docs.smooch.io/guide/jwt).


    #### Header


    The JWT header must contain the key id (kid) of the API key that is used to
    sign it. The algorithm (alg) used should be HS256. Unsigned JWTs are not
    accepted.


    ```javascript

    {
        "alg": "HS256",
        "typ": "JWT",
        "kid": "act_5963ceb97cde542d000dbdb1"
    }

    ```


    #### Payload


    The JWT payload must include a scope claim which specifies the caller’s
    scope of access.


    - account-scoped JWTs must be generated with an API key associated with a
    Sunshine Conversations account (act*) or service account (svc*).


    ```javascript

    {
        "scope": "account"
    }

    ```


    - app-scoped JWTs can be generated with an API key associated with an app
    (app\_).


    ```javascript

    {
       "scope": "app"
    }

    ```

      ## Attachments for Messages

      The attachments API allows you to upload a file for the purpose of sending
      a message.

      Using the for parameter, you can signal to Sunshine Conversations that
      your upload will be used to send a message to a user.

      Knowing this, Sunshine Conversations will safely delete the attachment
      when the message, conversation or user is deleted.

      set. You can use webhooks to build your own Sunshine Conversations chat
      clients, to integrate more deeply with your favorite CRM, or to build a
      bot.

      A webhook can only operate within the scope of a single Sunshine
      Conversations app.

      <aside class="notice">An app is limited to 10 webhooks. A webhook can
      subscribe to multiple trigger events. We recommend using a single webhook
      that registers to all the events you need.</aside>


      ## Webhook Triggers

      When a webhook trigger is triggered, a POST request will be made to the
      URL configured in your webhook object along with a JSON payload specific
      for the event type.


      | Trigger                 | Description                       |

            Facebook Messenger Setup steps:

            Take note of your Facebook app ID and secret (apps can be created at
            developer.facebook.com);

            The Facebook app must have been submitted to Facebook for approval
            with the “manage_pages” (to receive messages through webhook) and
            “pages_messaging” (to send messages) permissions.

            In order to integrate a Facebook Messenger app you must acquire a
            Page Access Token from your user. Once you have acquired a page
            access token from your user, call the Create Integration endpoint
            with your app secret and ID and the user’s page access token.

                    generate a link request to transfer the user to a different
                    channel.

                    * `message` - The conversation was created because a message
                    was sent.

                    * `none` - The conversation was not created for a specific
                    purpose. Used primarily when a conversation is created via
                    the Create Conversation API.

                    * `notification` - The conversation was created by a call to
                    the Notification API.

                    * `prechatCapture` - The conversation was created because
                    the user completed a prechat capture form in the Web
                    Messenger.

                    * `startConversation` - The conversation was created because
                    of a call to the startConversation API on one of the SDK
                    integrations, or a start conversation event was triggered
                    from a messaging channel.
